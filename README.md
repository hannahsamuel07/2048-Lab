# 2048 
## Introduction
#### When I first started learning 2D Arrays, I recreated some of the game functions of 2048. By learning to move tile objects up and down or left and right, these tile motions came together to create the 2048 game. In this lab, I learned how to implement helper methods and access/ travel 2D arrays. This lab helped me better understand how to visualize a 2d array and the function you can create to change the contents of the array based on the user key inputs.
